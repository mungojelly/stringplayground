# stringplayground

_a home for lonely string functions_

this is just a harmless little toy made of clojure functions that
produce and transform strings and collections of strings

send @mungojelly string functions you've written and they can probably
find a home here, even they're very simple or silly

## areas of the playground

### already somewhat existent

- **stringplayground.sandbox** has functions that produce or process
  finite strings, which soon will include treating strings containing
  regular newlines as two-dimensional boxes

### vaguely planned

- **stringplayground.slides** could be functions on infinite streams of
  characters

- **stringplayground.monkeybars** could be functions on streams of
  finite strings, such as treating them as animations

- **stringplayground.junglegym** could make complex heterogenous
  structures from those parts

- **stringplayground.swingset** could be a gui front end
